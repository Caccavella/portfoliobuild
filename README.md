Custom-built portfolio website created using React designed to showcase skills, add projects to be displayed as I complete them, and demonstrate my ability to program as a junior web developer. The design was original, adopted based on a few example setups on various themes found around the internet, with paralax built into the picture displays. The website itself is also mobile responsive, as are the projects that are displayed therein.
